AzureR is a family of packages for working with [Azure](https://microsoft.com/azure) from R. They are designed to be lightweight yet powerful by working directly with the Azure REST API, without any dependencies on other languages.

The family includes the following members. All the packages are available on [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org), and the individual repositories are also mirrored at the [cloudyr project](https://cloudyr.github.io).

| Package | Description |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|

Use this package to obtain OAuth 2.0 tokens for any Azure service that uses AAD for authentication. It supports AAD v1.0 and v2.0; authenticating with certificates; and multiple authentication flows, including authorization code, device code, client credentials, on-behalf-of and resource owner grant. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureAuth)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureAuth) <br> ![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Azure/AzureAuth/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg) |
| [![AzureGraph](images/AzureGraph.png)](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGraph) | **[AzureGraph](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGraph)** is an R6-based interface to [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/), focusing on Azure Active Directory. Its main functionality revolves around registered apps and service principals, with a view to supporting the other packages in the family, but it can also be used to manage other objects in Graph. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureGraph)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureGraph) <br> ![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGraph/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg) |

It enables working with subscriptions, resource groups, resources and templates: resources can be created, updated and deleted, templates can be deployed and removed, and role-based permissions assigned. Most of the other AzureR packages extend AzureRMR to provide more features specific to a given service. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureRMR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureRMR) <br> ![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Azure/AzureRMR/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg) |

Future versions may add support for other Microsoft 365 services. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureCosmosR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureCosmosR) <br> ![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Azure/AzureCosmosR/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg) |



Currently, AzureR is not intended to support all of Azure; its focus is mainly on the Azure services that are most likely to be relevant to R users.
