AzureR is a family of packages for working with [Azure](https://microsoft.com/azure) from R. They are designed to be lightweight yet powerful by working directly with the Azure REST API, without any dependencies on other languages.

The family includes the following members. All the packages are available on [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org), and the individual repositories are also mirrored at the [cloudyr project](https://cloudyr.github.io).

| Package | Description |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
| :-----: | ----------- | :----: |
| [![AzureAuth](images/AzureAuth.png)](https://github.com/Azure/AzureAuth) | **[AzureAuth](https://github.com/Azure/AzureAuth)** provides [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/index) authentication functionality. Use this package to obtain OAuth 2.0 tokens for any Azure service that uses AAD for authentication. It supports AAD v1.0 and v2.0; authenticating with certificates; and multiple authentication flows, including authorization code, device code, client credentials, on-behalf-of and resource owner grant. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureAuth)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureAuth) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureAuth?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master) |
| [![AzureRMR](images/AzureRMR.png)](https://github.com/Azure/AzureRMR) | **[AzureRMR](https://github.com/Azure/AzureRMR)** is an R6-based interface to [Azure Resource Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/resource-manager/). It enables working with subscriptions, resource groups, resources and templates: resources can be created, updated and deleted, templates can be deployed and removed, and role-based permissions assigned. Most of the other AzureR packages extend AzureRMR to provide more features specific to a given service. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureRMR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureRMR) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureRMR?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master) |
| [![AzureGraph](images/AzureGraph.png)](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGraph) | **[AzureGraph](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGraph)** is an R6-based interface to [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/), focusing on Azure Active Directory. Its main functionality revolves around registered apps and service principals, with a view to supporting the other packages in the family, but it can also be used to manage other objects in Graph. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureGraph)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureGraph) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureGraph?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=5&branchName=master) |
| [![AzureKeyVault](images/AzureKeyVault.png)](https://github.com/Azure/AzureKeyVault) | **[AzureKeyVault](https://github.com/Azure/AzureKeyVault)** provides a Resource Manager and client interface to [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/). It supports all operations with objects stored in Key Vault, such as encryption and decryption, certificate signing, and storage account key management. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureKeyVault)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureKeyVault) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureKeyVault?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=9&branchName=master) |

Build a Docker image and push it to ACR; deploy it to ACI; or create a service on AKS. As a bonus, AzureContainers can talk to any Docker registry or Kubernetes cluster, not just those in Azure. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureContainers)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureContainers) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureContainers?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master) |

It provides a flexible, powerful interface that lets you customise nearly all aspects of the deployment, including reusing existing resources. A selection of predefined configurations is also included to allow easy deployment of commonly used Linux and Windows images. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureVM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureVM) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureVM?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master) |

Both a Resource Manager interface, extending AzureRMR, and a client interface to the REST APIs are provided. While it can be called by the end-user, it is meant to provide a foundation for other packages that will support specific services, like Computer Vision, LUIS (language understanding), etc. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureCognitive)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureCognitive) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureCognitive?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=12&branchName=master) |
| [![AzureVision](images/AzureVision.png)](https://github.com/Azure/AzureVision) | **[AzureVision](https://github.com/Azure/AzureVision)** is an interface to [Azure Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) and [Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/), building on the low-level functionality provided by the AzureCognitive package. These services let you leverage the cloud to carry out visual recognition tasks using advanced image processing models, without needing powerful hardware of your own. | [![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/AzureVision)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureVision) <br> [![Build Status](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_apis/build/status/Azure.AzureVision?branchName=master&label=build)](https://asiadatascience.visualstudio.com/AzureR/_build/latest?definitionId=13&branchName=master) |

Currently, AzureR is not intended to support all of Azure; its focus is mainly on the Azure services that are most likely to be relevant to R users.
